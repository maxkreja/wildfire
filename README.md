# Wildfire Simulator ğŸ”¥

This is a game which I created for an assignment at school. It simulates wildfires. I did not use any real data for this simulation, don't expect results that can be compared with the real world. The simulation is based on these assumptions:

- evergreens ğŸŒ² are easier to ignite than trees with leafs ğŸŒ³
- grass ğŸŒ¿ is easier to ignite than trees
- any plant close to water ğŸ’¦ is harder to ignite than a plant far away from water
- cigarettes ğŸš¬ can ignite grass and trees
